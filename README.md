# FidiScript

A new programming language......yup, that's it.

So FidiScript is an illegitimate kid to python and my boredom. It is interpreted over python with grammar rules set on a syntax tree parsed with binary tree. The lexer interprets all tokens predefined to follow grammar syntax rules and form an expression. The predefined lexer tokens range from basic identifiers to complete function definitions.


## Getting started

Here is an example how to get this thing running on your local machine. 

### Requirements:
- Python (obviously, duh)
- PC
- Willingness to waste some time here

### Installation and setup

1. Clone the repo using github cli
```
gh repo clone prashanth-up/FidiScript 
```
or do it like a lame kid
```
git clone https://github.com/prashanth-up/FidiScript.git
```
2. Navigate to root directory and run shell.py
```
python shell.py
```
3. That's it. Your CLI based language interpreter should be running now. It should look like this
```
fidiscript>
```
